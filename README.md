## What is Numpy?
NumPy, short for "Numerical Python," is a popular open-source Python library for numerical and scientific computing.
NumPy is a fundamental library for data manipulation and scientific computing in Python and is often used in conjunction with other libraries like SciPy, Matplotlib, and pandas.

## What is the need of Numpy?
It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide range of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
Its efficiency, multi-dimensional array support, and extensive mathematical functions make it a powerful tool for a wide range of applications, 
from data analysis and machine learning to simulations and scientific research.
